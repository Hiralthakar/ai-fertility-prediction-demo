Mini fertility tracking AI project using Python
# ðŸ§  AI for Fertility: Mini Demo Project

This is a beginner-level project exploring how **artificial intelligence** can assist in **fertility prediction** using menstrual cycle data.

## ðŸš€ Goal

To show early steps in applying **data science and machine learning** for **womenâ€™s reproductive health**, specifically focusing on:
- Fertility window prediction
- Menstrual pattern tracking

## ðŸ—‚ What's Included
- `fertility_dummy_data.csv`: Sample menstrual cycle dataset (dummy data)
- `fertility_ai_demo.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that:
  - Loads and analyzes the data
  - Visualizes cycle patterns
  - Uses a basic AI model (Decision Tree) to predict ovulation day

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier)

## ðŸ§­ Why This Matters

Fertility tracking is critical for many women but often lacks personalization. AI can help improve:
- Accuracy of ovulation predictions
- Early diagnosis of conditions like PCOS
- Women's health access in underserved regions

## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm exploring a **PhD in AI for Womenâ€™s Fertility & Reproductive Health**.  
This project is part of my learning journey â€” from teaching to applying AI in FemTech.  
Iâ€™m open to collaboration, feedback, and mentorship.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Integrate real-world data (with privacy ethics)
- Extend to PCOS detection and personalized fertility apps
- Publish a blog post about my learning

## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm a university-level computer science educator with 15+ years of teaching experience.  
Now, Iâ€™m deeply motivated to pursue a **PhD in AI for Womenâ€™s Fertility & Reproductive Health** â€” a field I find both meaningful and full of real-world impact.

This project marks the beginning of my transition from teaching to research.  
Under the guidance of a future PhD supervisor, I hope to grow into a strong contributor in this space, focusing on ethical, data-driven, and accessible solutions for womenâ€™s health.

I welcome feedback, collaboration, and any opportunity to contribute to this vital area.
